# ArpOn - Plaits: Macro oscillator, with arpeggios

Acts like a normal plaits, until you enable arpeggios in the settings

## Warning - you will need to calibrate your plaits module after flashing it with new firmware.
### This is experimental firmware, please reflash your plaits module with the original firmware if required.
